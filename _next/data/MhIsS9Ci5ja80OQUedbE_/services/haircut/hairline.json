Rachel took the time to talk to me about what I wanted and how things had been done successfully and not successfully in the past.   She came up with her own new solution and it worked beautifully!  I have long naturally chestnut colored hair that needed some grey covered over.  I wanted to stay a brunette but with Carmel blond highlights, no ash blond - which looks just like grey in my hair.

Dimitri answered the phone himself and set me up with an appointment within a few days with Rachel.  It was simple and painless and no having to sign your life away online, but you can book online if you want to.   Rachel took the time to talk to me about what I wanted and how things had been done successfully and not successfully in the past.   She came up with her own new solution and it worked beautifully!  I have long naturally chestnut colored hair that needed some grey covered over.  I wanted to stay a brunette but with Carmel blond highlights, no ash blond - which looks just like grey in my hair.    Rachel did her magic and it turned out perfect.   I am very happy and highly recommend."},"platformLogo":"https://ik.imagekit.io/zoca/bookinglogo/google.svg"},{"id":"d4c58fe1-4995-4c61-ad43-4b2818dafe44","date":"2025-01-23T19:13:58.114667","platform":"GBP","reviewer":{"name":"Thalia J","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWigsalTWNtiVzo0mMFMNrcyq0MjUnkNIIssYwPg--nKMTgn6mArA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100","rating":5,"review":"Dimitri is fantastic!
